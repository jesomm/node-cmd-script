## node-cmd-script

As part of integrating two different source depot branches, I needed to generate some XML and run a huge number of sd commands. While I could have done this with [batch scripting](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/batch_script/index.htm), I thought it would be interesting to use Node's CLI instead.

Posting this to GitHub on the off chance somebody else wants to do the same thing?

### Note

This is all very windows-y but could be made less environment-specific if needed.
